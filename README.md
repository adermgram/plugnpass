iPhone File Transfer Utility for Linux

## Description

PlugNPass (pronounced "Plug and Pass") is a simple, user-friendly utility for transferring files between Linux computers and iOS devices (iPhone, iPad). It provides an easy graphical interface for accessing your iOS device's media and documents.

## Features

- **Media Access**: Browse and download photos, videos, and music from your iOS device

## Installation

### Method 1: Using the .deb package (Recommended for Ubuntu/Debian)

Download the .deb package and install with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./plugnpass_1.0.0_all.deb
```

This will automatically install all dependencies and set up the application.

```bash
sudo apt install ifuse libimobiledevice-utils usbmuxd fuse python3 python3-tk
```

   git clone https://github.com/adermgram/plugnpass.git
   cd plugnpass
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```

The installer will:
- Make the app executable
